    <h1>Let's reflect on Foundations and the Core learnings!</h1>
    <h2>What 3 things have I learned about myself?</h2>
    <p>Well there&rsquo;s a nice chunky topic&hellip; Let&rsquo;s dive on in:</p>
    <p>Firstly, turns out I enjoy programming more than I&rsquo;d thought! I knew it was something I liked doing and that it
      felt like a good fit whenever I&rsquo;ve tried, but I found myself genuinely having fun with each of the tasks and
      challenges - it turned out to be more satisfying than I&rsquo;d thought!</p>
    <p>Second, I&rsquo;m basically incapable of breaking up my day and taking regular breaks. I can take a day off, or start
      late and just work for the afternoon, but I get so absorbed in what I&rsquo;m doing that I really struggle to step
      away every hour or two for a small break. Hasn&rsquo;t presented any kind of issue so far, but definitely something
      I&rsquo;d noticed and something I&rsquo;ve never been able to do before - normally I&rsquo;ve been the exact opposite,
      my whole day is a series of breaks with brief moments of work in between. What a difference good mental health care
      makes ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>And third, I&rsquo;m bloody useless at this kind of question! These kinds of very abstract, open ended questions -
      like &ldquo;what have you learned&rdquo;, &ldquo;how do you feel about x&rdquo;, &ldquo;explain your thought behind
      y&rdquo; - are the exact opposite of what my brain likes to deal with. Ask a specific question, the closer to
      something with a right or wrong answer the better, and I&rsquo;ll have a detailed answer instantly. Give me an open
      question without a clear answer and I&rsquo;m super lost (I&rsquo;m writing this section at the end and it&rsquo;s
      taken me nearly as long as the rest!).</p>
    <p>Again, this isn&rsquo;t something that really bothers me or feels like too much of a limitation, just an interesting
      observation and something I&rsquo;ve come to understand more.</p>
    <h2>How do values, empathy and self awareness working with learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>So many ways!</p>
    <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start with learning</strong></p>
    <p>Learning is influenced by all of these to a massive degree.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your values are hugely important, if you value frank discussions, self directed tasks and freedom to go at your own
      pace then that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll learn best. For example, I know I value structure, clear expectations and the
      ability to get stuck in a try stuff until it works - so I know that while watching an intro video is a nice warmup, I
      need to focus on the practical tasks (blogs, coding, exercises) to make the most of my learning.Self awareness is
      probably the greatest tool when it comes to learning. The more you understand your strengths and limitations, as well
      as how you react to things, manage yourself and your feelings and how your brain works, the better you can approach
      learning the right way.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m constitutionally incapable of self-monitoring, so these reflections, blog posts and discussions are
      extremely important for getting me to recognise and take in what I&rsquo;ve been learning and feeling. I also tend to
      switch off if I have too much free time or lack of structure in a task or day, so I know that finding external sources
      of structure when they aren&rsquo;t built into my day&rsquo;s tasks is vital to keep me focused and productive -
      having people that know what I want to accomplish in a day and will check in on how it went at the end of the day as
      well as very clear expectations of which small tasks need doing and when is extremely useful in my day, otherwise I
      can pretty easily spend several hours writing a blog post that only needed to be a quick discussion.</p>
    <p>Lastly, empathy is huge. First for your peers; taking the time and energy to check in with the people around you,
      understand how they&rsquo;re feeling and what they might be struggling with let&rsquo;s you connect better with them
      (huge when you&rsquo;re in a team) and support each other, but it also reminds you that the things you&rsquo;re
      struggling with are common struggles across the whole team - you&rsquo;re not alone in the struggle, you&rsquo;re not
      struggling because you can&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s just hard and everyone is in the same boat!</p>
    <p><strong>How about programming?</strong></p>
    <p>Programming is influenced in very similar ways to learning, in fact programming is a permanent state of learning so
      maybe that shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising!</p>
    <p>Values matter here in a big way. When we&rsquo;re coding, we&rsquo;re creating something. Something that could be
      used by other people, worked on by others or directly affect them. Sticking to your values and making sure that what
      you make lives up to your values is important to working with pride in your creations.</p>
    <p>Empathy is probably the biggest, for me. When it comes to programming out in the wild, I&rsquo;ll be working in a
      team, writing code that others will have to work with and creating software that others will use. This ties in with
      self awareness too, being aware of how you program is vital in assessing the impact it&rsquo;ll have on others.I know
      that my code can get a little hard to follow at times, a product of my tendency to take great leaps in logic, jump
      between functions and take sometimes confusing routes to completing tasks (thanks brain). That&rsquo;s fine by me, I
      wrote the code so I generally know how it works, but it can be tough to follow if you&rsquo;re just picking it up and
      even worse if you&rsquo;re trying to follow along as I write it (along with my difficulty self-monitoring, explaining
      my thoughts is extremely difficult).</p>
    <p>That means I need to be sure my variables are very clearly labelled, I&rsquo;ve got the right comments in there to
      keep it clear and I can explain how it works to people.</p>
    <p>Empathy for the users and customers is also important. If your creation is intended to be used by people in stressful
      circumstances (medical or financial software, for example) then it needs to be as simple, clear and calming as
      possible. If someone is trying to use an app to call roadside assistance after a car crash, sending them through a
      half dozen submenus, information fields and logins is definitely <strong>not</strong> going to make life easy for
      them.</p>
    <h2>So what&rsquo;s been surprising? What was tough?</h2>
    <p>I definitely surprised myself with the growth mindset and neuroplasticity sections. They&rsquo;re both concepts
      I&rsquo;d had an awareness of before, but I&rsquo;d never actually done any proper research or learning.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What I felt wasn&rsquo;t surprise, but the exact opposite!</p>
    <p>It turns out I&rsquo;d always operated under those two principles! It wasn&rsquo;t conscious, I didn&rsquo;t have a
      label or background for it, but they&rsquo;re both things I&rsquo;ve generally believed to be true in general. You can
      always learn things, otherwise you&rsquo;d never be able to drive to a new place, spell a new word, find a new
      favourite lunch spot or remember a phone number as an adult - those things are all learning as much as understanding
      how to code is - and it makes sense that you can get better with practice.</p>
    <p>In terms of difficulty, the hardest task to actually <strong>do</strong> were the listening and looping. I&rsquo;ve
      mentioned my ADHD a handful of times here, but this is a particularly relevant topic. It&rsquo;s not something that
      bothers me or I try to hide, with the right things in place it generally isn&rsquo;t a hugely negative part of me
      (sometimes positive!) - but tasks like this, or that first question here, are almost perfectly incompatible with my
      brain!</p>
    <p>It took a bit of practice to get those right, but being aware of how I react to listening and conversations and
      taking the right steps to prepare for them means I can manage without too much trouble (at least in small doses!).</p>
    <h2>What&rsquo;s the importance of all this core stuff anyway?</h2>
    <p>Ahhh.. I have a bit of insight into this, given my previous job was entirely about placing people into jobs in the
      tech world - especially developers.Assuming someone had the experience and skills to land an interview, the
      overwhelming reason they got a job offer or not, the biggest deciding factor, was their interpersonal and core skills.
      I don&rsquo;t mean having developed strong core skills gave them an edge over others, I mean it was 100% make or
      break.</p>
    <p>Working in this field means working with others, constantly dealing with relationships, politics, requests, demands,
      roadblocks and complications - without the core skills to overcome challenges or work effectively with other people,
      it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to work successfully and THAT is what employers always look for.</p>
    <p>Core skills don&rsquo;t just make getting through the learning journey easier, they make you more successful in your
      coding and your career.</p>
    <h2>So is the core learning valuable?</h2>
    <p>... Did you read that last section? Of course it&rsquo;s valuable!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Programming is a tool, it lets you make things that solve a problem. But without the core skills, it&rsquo;s hard to
      actually <strong>use</strong> those tools to make the right thing, to make it with others and to use the tools to your
      best potential.</p>
    <p>Imagine being a builder. You can be as good as you like at joining together bits of wood, making fancy windows and
      all the rest. You know how to programme the crap out of a house!</p>
    <p>But without developing any core skills, you&rsquo;ll find it harder to deal with your customers, the other
      tradespeople and you&rsquo;ll struggle to understand what your customers really want built and how to work with
      them.Basically, the programming is a tool but the core skills let you use it to a much greater potential!</p>
