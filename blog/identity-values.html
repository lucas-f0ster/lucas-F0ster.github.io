            <h1>Core Values</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>An ethical choice</h2>
            <p>There aren&rsquo;t too many times where my ethics and values have been tested, but the most recent that springs to
                mind is a situation at my former job.This was an office with a wide variety of people, ranging from 19 to over 50
                years old and a complete mix of all kinds.I&rsquo;d noticed that one of the older members of the team had been
                making advances and various physical contact with the youngest, which she was visibly uncomfortable with. There
                wasn&rsquo;t actually anything sinister about it, but it clearly wasn&rsquo;t okay and not the sort of behaviour
                that would make someone feel safe and happy at work.I brought it up with her to see if she was as bothered as she
                seemed, which she was. But, she didn&rsquo;t want to raise it with anyone or escalate the problem as she
                didn&rsquo;t feel it was worth it and didn&rsquo;t want to cause any problems.That&rsquo;s where the values argument
                came in. She had specifically said she didn&rsquo;t want anything done about it, but it also couldn&rsquo;t carry on
                so I had to make a choice between doing the right thing (escalating it higher) despite being asked not to, or
                respecting the wishes of a good friend.In the end, I called him out a few times which didn&rsquo;t solve it before
                deciding to eventually raise it with our manager, who dealt with it very tactfully and as far as I could tell, that
                was the end of it.The young person in question was never actually told anything had been done about it and I&rsquo;d
                asked that my involvement be kept quiet, so it seems like it worked out well in the end.</p>
            <p>Those values I&rsquo;d describe as loyalty and a desire to help others, which were the two responses I received from
                a very close friend (and former colleague) when I asked him to give me his thoughts on my values.</p>
            <h2>Cultural influences on values and identity</h2>
            <p>This is a really tricky one for me, I don&rsquo;t feel a particularly strong cultural connection in any direction. My
                closest connections come from my immediate family, specifically my parents.Both my parents are kiwis, but have lived
                in Australia and the UK for long periods and I&rsquo;d describe them as culturally English with kiwi and Aussie
                influences, which has influenced my own identity (note my &ldquo;accent&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t actually have one but
                I regularly get mistaken as British).</p>
            <p>So those English-ish influences, the overall personalities of my parents (laidback, fairly private, practical and
                very logical) are a big factor in who I am. In terms of values, I&rsquo;d say I derive a lot of these from my
                parents, taking the logic and pragmatic approaches of my mother as well as the more laidback, kindness first aspects
                of my father.In addition to my family, I&rsquo;ve taken on some values and identity from my environments, especially
                growing up in a very rural, farming community (not on a farm, however).&nbsp; Which meant developing a very down to
                Earth, pragmatic, band together kind of mindset.That was very different from the environment I found after returning
                to Wellington to start university, where things are much more individualistic and private, so I&rsquo;ve got a mix
                of both aspects in there somewhere.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <p>I pride myself on logical thinking and reasoning, which typically leads to strong problem solving.I&rsquo;m also (as
                in the values section) resilient and persistent, I&rsquo;m not one to get overwhelmed or stressed out. I normally
                just keep on keeping on and get through difficulties. This is a helpful one, especially in a programme as full on as
                this one, since I&rsquo;m not likely to be dissuaded by setbacks or workloads.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I&rsquo;m fairly sociable. Surprising, given my INTP-A personality result and strong introversion, but I do
                find I enjoy helping others, discussing problems and solutions and typically get along well with people - my
                introversion comes more from socialising being tiring than it being an activity I struggle with.</p>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>My attention span is pretty minimal, in fact it&rsquo;s a diagnosed disorder! That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve
                struggled with my whole life, but something that&rsquo;s being managed after getting it properly looked at 2 months
                before starting EDA (part of why I delayed starting).I&rsquo;ve had huge improvements, but it&rsquo;s something I do
                have to constantly keep working at and monitoring, so a potential pitfall.I also struggle with asking for help, I
                like to pride myself on being very independent and resourceful, but there&rsquo;s always going to be a point where
                I&rsquo;ll need someone&rsquo;s input and help, emotionally or practically, and it&rsquo;s a challenge for me to get
                there.</p>
            <h2>Strengths and the learningjourney</h2>
            <p>That resilience is going to be a good one, this is going to be a hectic course with tight deadlines, and I&rsquo;m
                confident I&rsquo;ll be able to use that persistence to keep on pushing through and shrug off some of the stress.
            </p>
            <p>I also feel the social side will come in handy, helping others and building bonds is going to be important for
                creating an environment we can do well on and vital for the pair and group work coming in Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>That resilience is also going to be useful when my attention issues rear up. It can wear you down when you know what
                you need to do and genuinely want to do it, but can&rsquo;t force your brain to actually process the information and
                take action. Sticking with it and keeping calm in those situations is really the only way through!</p>
            <h2>Working with others</h2>
            <p>Oh there are so many instances&hellip;</p>
            <p>My previous job was in a sales-heavy environment and my colleagues could best be described as &ldquo;divas&rdquo;,
                myself included I&rsquo;m sure.Lot&rsquo;s of issues come up in a busy, loud environment but 2 that come to mind are
                these:</p>
            <p>First, while working closely with a colleague I found that she was becoming increasingly frustrated that I
                wasn&rsquo;t working in a way that meshed with her style, while I was getting annoyed that she wasn&rsquo;t valuing
                the work I was producing and was expecting more and more each time. None of this was ever mentioned directly, just
                alluded to in snide remarks, overall tension or our actions.</p>
            <p>In the end, we reached a point where we either had to fix it, or basically ignore each other.</p>
            <p>So, I asked her to come with me for a coffee and we sat down to chat. I asked if there was something I was doing
                wrong, and what she would prefer and offered some suggestions to her in turn.Really, our issues stemmed from
                inconsistent communications and wildly differing expectations in a team member. Getting those issues out in the
                open, establishing what our expectations looked like and agreeing on our communications style and actions going
                forward really helped out.</p>
            <p>If I were to be in that situation again, I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;d be able to recognise that things were
                going south and becoming tense well before it got as toxic as it did that time. I was very inexperienced in a
                business environment and younger than I am now, I&rsquo;d hope that the years of experience after that time would
                give me more of an ability to see when tensions are developing and step in a clear things up before it became a
                major problem.</p>
