    <h1>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h1>
<h2>So your brain is made of plastic?</h2>
<p>Nope. The term plasticity means &ldquo;being easily shaped or moulded&rdquo;. Think of a pane of glass, it can bend a very, very tiny amount before it shatters - not very plastic. Now picture a metal wire, lots of bending and it&rsquo;ll hold whatever shape you bend it to - very plastic.</p>
<p>This is what we mean by plasticity, neuroplasticity is a description of how malleable and adaptable your brain is (hence the &lsquo;neuro&rsquo;). The greater the neuroplasticity, the easier your brain can physically form, strengthen and change the millions of tiny connections inside itself.</p>
<h2>So it&rsquo;s important?</h2>
<p>Very! Once you receive a piece of information, your brain makes the connections it needs to remember it. But those first connections are weak and fresh, and your brain constantly removes connections it doesn&rsquo;t use very often. So to strengthen those connections, we have to practice! That means being reminded of the information, repeating activities that require that knowledge so your brain has to access over and over. The more we repeat these actions, the stronger that link is until it becomes almost permanent.</p>
<p>Remember learning to ride a bike? At first, it&rsquo;s super hard. The connections are new and weak and it takes lots and lots of practice for it to become an unconscious activity, before your brain can just ride around without you having to think about it. Once you&rsquo;ve done it enough, those connections are strong enough that you can remember how to do it years later.</p>
<p>The best part? Just <strong>knowing</strong> about neuroplasticity and understanding that your brain can change and grow and that your &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; evolves changes how your brain develops and makes learning easier and more effective!</p>
<h2>So how do I do this neuroplasticity thing?</h2>
<p>Firstly, engaging with these principles means practising new skills and knowledge as you receive them. Just recalling the knowledge later on strengthens those connections. So at the end of each week, return to the topics covered and review them - trigger those connections and strengthen them.</p>
<p>Second, practise really matters! What&rsquo;s the best way to remember how to use a new coffee machine? Use it lots! Along with just reading over your learning, practise that knowledge practically. For programming, that might be finding yourself challenges to complete that use the knowledge you&rsquo;ve recently gained. The more you do, the more you remember.</p>
<p>The more you practice, the more your brain&rsquo;s neuroplasticity develops. If you&rsquo;re used to forming new connections and making them super strong,&nbsp; your brain gets better at it. After all, the brain is a muscle like all your others (just very complex). In the same way that cardio exercises makes your heart stronger, so does exercising your brain&rsquo;s neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Want to read a proper scientific explanation about how this works and why it matters? I&rsquo;ve got you covered!&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01657/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out this article</a>, instead of some guy on the internet it was written by qualified people with letters after their names!</p>
<h2>So what was that about Growth Mindsets? Is it related?</h2>
<p>Sure is!</p>
<p>Having a Growth Mindset means approaching everything you do with the understanding that your brain changes, grows and develops - understand the concept of Neuroplasticity and its effects.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare.</p>
<p>A fixed mindset would be the belief that your underlying abilities are set in stone, they come from your genes and they&rsquo;ll never change. This is extremely common, but dangerous! Imagine if you believed you had to have natural talents built into you in order to learn something? Well the first time you tried, you&rsquo;d struggle, because it&rsquo;s new information and your brain doesn&rsquo;t have the connections it needs yet. So you&rsquo;d assume you&rsquo;re &ldquo;just not very good at it&rdquo;, or that you &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; and give up.</p>
<p>A growth mindset would be understanding that your brain is a pile of grey goop that changes constantly. You understand that learning new skills means developing new connections in your brain and that this is something you do every single day. You&rsquo;d go in, struggle at first but understand that you need to develop your connections and eventually you&rsquo;re getting somewhere!</p>
<p>Is that a surprise? Well it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Think about your body, it&rsquo;s a hive of activity that never stops. If your cells stopped doing their jobs for even a minute or two, you&rsquo;d be dead. Every single second, you&rsquo;re growing new cells, changing how your body works, removing dead stuff and performing hundreds of tiny processes.</p>
<p>If you never used your legs, they&rsquo;d be like toothpicks - your body doesn&rsquo;t spend energy building muscles it never uses. But get to doing some squats and those muscles grow, your body recognises that it needs your leg muscles to be well built to do the tasks it needs to.</p>
<p>Now replace legs with brain, instead of exercising a muscle you&rsquo;re exercising your brain!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an organ like all the rest, so it stands to reason that it changes like the others. When we practice neuroplasticity, we&rsquo;re just making sure we exercise our brains in a deliberate way - the difference between just picking up heavy things and lifting weights in a set form.</p>
<h2>Gotcha! Brain is a muscle, it can change and we need to practice growing it. How does that relate to my learning journey?</h2>
<p>Exactly how you&rsquo;d think. When embarking on any learning journey, whether it&rsquo;s learning to paint, drive a car or even learn to code, it&rsquo;s important to approach everything with a growth mindset.</p>
<p>We need to understand that the first time we receive information, the connections that make up our brain are weak and narrow. So we practice accessing that information, review our learning, give ourselves practice challenges that use that knowledge.</p>
<p>Importantly, we give ourselves challenges that tie multiple pieces of information together. That way, they&rsquo;re all linked inside the brain and we don&rsquo;t just remember each section, we grow our understanding across the whole subject.</p>
<p>A growth mindset also means remembering that what seems complicated and intimidating now will become second nature as we strengthen that area of our brains. Writing your first For Loop in JavaScript is confusing, you have to constantly go back and remind yourself how it should work.</p>
<p>Writing the 100th one takes no effort at all, the pathways to access the knowledge and relate it to other information are developing and strong and that&rsquo;s the process we go through with every piece of learning.</p>
<p>So practice, refresh your memory and don&rsquo;t give up! Your brain will develop as you learn, just because you struggle now doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll ever know.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t just take my word from it, <a href="https://www.learninghub.ac.nz/study-skills/growth-mindset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&rsquo;s a great explanation</a> from the folks at Auckland University, it has videos and pictures and everything!</p>
<h2>Should knowing this affect my Learning Plan?</h2>
<p>Absolutely! Practicing neuroplasticity is something you should include in your plan.Set yourself goals for when and what information you&rsquo;ll review, commit to a method that works for you and consider using a Growth Mindset when times get tough and you&rsquo;re feeling like the knowledge isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;sinking in&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing that all you need to do is practice, develop your connections and knowing that this is scientifically proven to be possible will be a great help in getting through the challenges to come!</p>
