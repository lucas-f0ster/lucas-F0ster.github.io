          <h1>It&rsquo;s a learning plan! And it&rsquo;s updated!</h1>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>Moving into development is the first step, of course. Long term I&rsquo;m still aiming to work up to more software
            architecture and design type positions, but I think that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve mentally pushed further into the
            future based on how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed programming in foundations.While I love taking a high level view of
            complex problems and working through all the little pieces, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to give up an
            addiction to those little eureka moments that I get while coding for a while!
          </p>
          <p>As to <strong>where</strong> I&rsquo;d like to be doing it, I don&rsquo;t really have concrete goals around specific
            industries or companies, but overall I want to be creating and working on things that people actually use and enjoy
            and my goal is to be doing that work in a place that&rsquo;s focused on creativity and wants to have some fun with it.
            I do know of at least one actual company that&rsquo;s like that, possibly two, in the creative and media space, so
            that&rsquo;s likely the direction I&rsquo;ll head in.
          </p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p>They&rsquo;ll be similar in root to the ones from foundations, but different in manifestation.

          </p>
          <p>My strengths will still lie in my passion for learning, curiosity and enjoyment for problem solving but will involve
            a little more of my enjoyment for helping others as well, since we&rsquo;ll be working much closer together through
            the journey.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>That resilience hasn&rsquo;t changed much, foundations has really emphasised how much I actually enjoy getting stuck,
            running into roadblocks and going down rabbit holes to find solutions - if anything that&rsquo;s a strength
            that&rsquo;s grown!
          </p>
          <p>My limitations will also be similar, not least my ADHD which I can see affecting Bootcamp a little differently. While
            in Foundations it&rsquo;s not been a major limitation, it&rsquo;s meant I had to be very careful about ensuring I have
            the structure and routine around me that I need.
          </p>
          <p>Heading into Bootcamp, I can see this being something I&rsquo;ll be working on when it comes to pair programming and
            teamwork in general. While I enjoy working alongside others, helping and cheerleading each other, I struggle more when
            it comes to working <strong>with</strong> others. I struggle a lot with explaining my thought processes, feelings and
            generally connecting my thinking and working with other people. But as with all things, being aware of it and keeping
            tabs on myself is going to make it easier to deal with, even if it&rsquo;s still going to be a major challenge.
          </p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          <p>Working closely with others could be a challenge. I&rsquo;ve been able to do well with it so far in life, but
            that&rsquo;s mainly been each person working on their own tasks as an overall group, as opposed to two people working
            directly on the same task or problem, so that&rsquo;ll be a learning experience for sure!
          </p>
          <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
          <p>Keeping focused could be a challenge in later weeks. My brain absolutely adores novelty, stress and challenge so I
            doubt there will be any issue keeping focused in the earlier portions, but after a few weeks I can see the novelty
            wearing off a little as the space, work and people become more familiar which is where I&rsquo;ll likely have to
            really keep on top of myself and my work.
          </p>
          <p>Beyond the focus, working super closely in pairs or small groups is a little newer for me. I&rsquo;ve never had any
            issue working in groups and teams, or with communicating with a group, but the kind of paired up work where both are
            working on the same task is newer for me so that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll be looking to learn and develop.
          </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>General guidance, understanding and encouragement are going to be pretty big.&nbsp;

          </p>
          <p>We all work in different ways, struggle with different things and will likely require different support - for me
            that&rsquo;ll be around getting the structure and direction I need to work effectively. I&rsquo;m not great with any
            deadline longer than the current day normally, because long stretches of unstructured time are basically an off switch
            for my brain, so structure is going to be hugely important.
          </p>
          <p>Beyond that structure, regular check ins and understanding are probably my biggest focus.

          </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p>That I get it done well! Workloads aren&rsquo;t an issue for me, so long as I&rsquo;m planning my time and routines
            properly. That&rsquo;ll look like basically having a pretty planned out day and week so I can keep myself accountable,
            and so I can be sure I&rsquo;m delivering what everyone around me requires.I also expect myself to be as involved as
            possible with my peers, cohort and EDA as a whole. Any journey is easier and more enjoyable if you&rsquo;re sharing it
            with others and feel a part of something. I&rsquo;ll also need to keep tabs on how I&rsquo;m connecting and
            communicating and ensure I&rsquo;m noticing when it&rsquo;s too little, and especially when it&rsquo;s too much.
          </p>
          <p>Lastly, I expect myself to have fun with it! None of this getting stressed and panicked nonsense, I intend to enjoy
            this experience, be curious about everything, focus on the fun and excitement and get as much out as possible. Instead
            of letting struggles build up, I&rsquo;ll be finding help as soon as I feel I&rsquo;m not super pumped and happy. As
            before, I&rsquo;ll be asking my peers first - we&rsquo;re a team and it&rsquo;s important for us all to be working
            together.If it&rsquo;s something more related to Bootcamp overall or not something any of us have an answer to,
            that&rsquo;ll be when I turn to the facilitators and ask them.
          </p>
          <h1>This one, not so updated</h1>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My goal is to move through development, ideally in the web/applications space, with a view to growing into an
                Architect position.</p>
            <p>I love technology and I enjoy coding very much, but what I enjoy most is solving problems, designing solutions and
                holding all that information in my head at once and making it work.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So starting out by solving smaller problems with code, moving on to creating larger and more complicated pieces of
                work and eventually stepping up to designing them from scratch, making them fit the problems at hand and leading
                others feels like a solid path to me.</p>
            <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
            <p>Well let&rsquo;s start off with the positives, some strengths.</p>
            <p>If I&rsquo;m really enjoying a particularly subject, challenge or working towards a goal I truly value, I tend to
                absorb information fairly well. I genuinely have a passion for learning as much as possible about just about any
                subject of interest, and having a true passion for your day to day work is about the best way to make sure
                it&rsquo;s a success!</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m also very resilient and persistent. When problems come up, big or small, which they always tend to do, I
                tend not to get stressed out or panic or walk away from the issue. For me, each potential setback is just another
                step that has to be taken to get to the endpoint, which I&rsquo;m hoping will work well in the development world
                where the problems are endless but the solutions are oh so satisfying.</p>
            <p>On to the limitations.</p>
            <p>Firstly, my attention span. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it a couple times here and there but I have ADHD and have done my
                whole life, although I only received an official diagnosis a few months before coming to EDA (in fact, waiting for
                the diagnosis is part of why I waited to enroll).</p>
            <p>As far as limitations go, an actual learning-related disorder is a big one but one that is being very well managed
                and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve made huge progress on in the past few months, which is a big source of
                pride for me.</p>
            <p>It still comes up every now and then, but right now it&rsquo;s very much under control and so far hasn&rsquo;t
                interfered with me working through sprints 1 and 2, but it&rsquo;s something I do have to be aware of just in case.
            </p>
            <p>I also struggle to actually ask for help. A good friend (and former manager) of mine and I had a chat about this and
                we basically decided that everyone sits somewhere on a scale from Asker to Googler.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some people come across something they don&rsquo;t understand and their first instinct is to ask someone else what it
                means, escalating up levels of experience/knowledge/seniority until they get the information.</p>
            <p>Others will turn to Google and escalate through various searches to find their answer.</p>
            <p>Where you sit on the spectrum basically comes down to how long it takes you to give up on searching yourself and
                raise your hand to ask someone else.</p>
            <p>Our conclusion was that I sit about as far to the Google side of the spectrum as possible, which can be good in that
                I tend to learn a lot more that way and it means I solve problems myself rather than roping in others who are
                probably focusing on their own work, but my reluctance to ask for help definitely can lead to me spending way too
                long down a rabbit hole trying to solve a problem that the person 2 metres to my left already knows the answer to.
            </p>
            <h2>A commitment to workload management</h2>
            <p>First, how will I manage myself:</p>
            <p>I tend to be very output or goal oriented. My method throughout these first sprints has been to check the learning
                competencies and timebox for an idea of how to work through the section, then work through the tasks one by one
                until they&rsquo;re completed.My approach is always to break down any large segment into individual tasks that I
                need to perform, then order them in a logical way and work down the list.</p>
            <p>Working in a team, I tend to do things in a similar way. Overall, the team has a goal and to achieve that goal
                certain criteria needs to be met. If each person is responsible for a set of criteria and understands the tasks
                required to fulfill them, I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s been pretty straightforward to know where we&rsquo;re all at,
                how we&rsquo;re tracking, which tasks are dependent on others and so on. Hasn&rsquo;t failed me yet!</p>
            <p>When it comes to things building up and getting hectic:</p>
            <p>I like to think I do well under pressure. I&rsquo;ve been in stressful situations plenty of times, where tasks are
                piling up under tight deadlines and I think there are a few aspects to getting through those times.Firstly,
                prioritising tasks, understanding which are totally non-negotiable, which can be reduced, which can be shifted back
                and so on, is very useful. If I&rsquo;ve got 8 hours of work and only 5 hours to do it, there&rsquo;s likely a few
                things that can have less time spent if they&rsquo;re not critical, or can be done to a sort of MVP level and
                enhanced later or can have their deadlines extended.In those situations, communicating with anyone who is requiring
                my outputs is my next move, get those expectations set ASAP so they&rsquo;re not expecting a result when one
                isn&rsquo;t coming.If that&rsquo;s not working, it&rsquo;s usually time to stand up, get out of the
                office/room/building, switch off the tech and clear my head. That might just be going for a walk, grabbing a coffee
                or whatever. That&rsquo;s usually where discussing it with others comes in, because they can either help directly
                with the problem, or at least act as a wall to bounce off - providing they&rsquo;re willing, of course!</p>
            <h2>How and where I&rsquo;ll seek help</h2>
            <p>Another logical, maths-y answer here. If, say, I have a timebox saying that 4 tasks should be taking me 2 hours and
                I&rsquo;ve passed the half hour mark and aren&rsquo;t close to getting the first one done, I&rsquo;m struggling and
                it&rsquo;s time to change the approach. If I&rsquo;ve gotten to that point, my own problem solving likely
                isn&rsquo;t giving me the solution so that&rsquo;s where others come in.My rough path of escalation would be to
                start with my teammates, whether that&rsquo;s asking in slack (either foundations, cohort or code-help-desk) or
                asking in person if we&rsquo;re all together. In the past, that solved the vast majority of problems already.</p>
            <p>If my teammates don&rsquo;t have the answer, or can&rsquo;t figure it out without impacting their work, then
                we&rsquo;re going up the ladder to EDA staff. That&rsquo;ll be whoever is the facilitator I&rsquo;m working with in
                foundations or bootcamp. This is also where I&rsquo;d go for more &lsquo;meta&rsquo; questions; is this the correct
                format for submission, am I working through this content in the right way, and so on, since my cohort is learning it
                at the same time I am!</p>
            <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p>A few things, obviously being available to answer burning questions is important, within reason. I&rsquo;m fine with
                a 24 hour response time, really. People have their own work to be getting on with!</p>
            <p>Patience is also important. I haven&rsquo;t hit any massive roadblocks just yet, but this is only the end of Sprint 2
                so things are going to get a lot tougher and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be times where I can&rsquo;t quite wrap
                my head around a concept on the first try!</p>
            <p>Lastly, mental health is going to matter. I mentioned I do well with stress, but when it does get rough I have a
                tendency to avoid asking for help for longer than I really should, so having a facilitation team that understands
                the struggles likely to come (and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re pretty experienced at this!) is going to be a huge
                help.</p>
            <h2>Any scheduling information?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely nothing! The only rigidly scheduled part of my daily routine was my job, which I left to join EDA, so feel
                free to absorb as much of my time as you like! A little time off on weekends would be nice, of course, but I&rsquo;m
                pretty comfortable making this the centre of my world for the foreseeable future!</p>
