        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>At a very basic level, Emotional Intelligence (or EQ) is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions.</p>
        <p>Most of us are able to to express our emotions just fine, it&rsquo;s something we do from birth - babies cry when they&rsquo;re hungry, laugh when they&rsquo;re happy and scream when they&rsquo;re angry - and over time we learn to control those emotions - you dropped a mug of tea and spilled it, irritating but you probably won&rsquo;t let it ruin your whole day.</p>
        <p>EQ is a step further than just having and expressing feelings. It starts with perceiving emotions, in others this is picking up on how someone is feeling through their words, tone, body language, expressions and all the subtle indicators we use in conversation.In ourselves, this is taking notice of how we&rsquo;re feeling and addressing it, instead of feeling &lsquo;crap&rsquo; we&rsquo;re feeling dissatisfied, angry, hurt or some other specific feeling.</p>
        <p>After perceiving emotions, we understand and manage them. EQ isn&rsquo;t just noticing that someone is upset, it&rsquo;s understanding the cause of that feeling (could you have done something to upset them? Or might they be upset because they had a flat tyre that morning?.</p>
        <p>In yourself, you might be upset after something you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time working on didn&rsquo;t turn out how you hoped, are you upset because it didn&rsquo;t work? Or is that feeling really coming from self-doubt, missing your expectations or because of the setback and extra work needed?</p>
        <p>Once we understand feelings and their causes, in ourselves and others, we can address and manage them. If you know your co-worker is getting short with people, and it&rsquo;s because something they&rsquo;ve been working on isn&rsquo;t coming together how they&rsquo;d hoped, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to offer advice, allow them to vent or lend a hand getting it done.</p>
        <p>In yourself, you notice that you&rsquo;re upset because your milk has gone off and you were really looking forward to that cup of tea. Evaluate that emotion, is it in proportion to the cause? What can be done? Most of the time, when we have a plan decided, life looks a lot rosier!</p>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>Firstly, IQ (or Intelligence Quotient) is usually measured with a strict test and is often considered an overall measure of intelligence - which isn&rsquo;t quite accurate. Your IQ number may be derived from a standardised test, but the concept has a lot in common with EQ.</p>
        <p>IQ refers to one&rsquo;s ability to learn, understand and apply different information across a variety of mental challenges like logic, abstract thinking or math skills. It&rsquo;s a (very rough) gauge of your mental capacity, flexibility and abilities. Think of IQ as &ldquo;relating to mental ability, specifically relating to problem solving and learning&rdquo;</p>
        <p>EQ (or Emotional Quotient), on the other hand relates to feelings and emotions. While IQ describes how well you might perform at a mental challenge, EQ describes how well you deal with emotions, lead others or work effectively in a team.</p>
        <p>But while IQ and EQ relate to different areas (emotions vs mental intelligence), they do share a lot of similarities. Firstly, neither are fixed and both can be developed, grown and expanded. You&rsquo;re constantly learning new information, expanding your IQ as you come across new challenges in life and remember the process for later. You&rsquo;re also always finding yourself in new social situations, dealing with questions you&rsquo;ve never been asked or dealing with others in new situations and you remember these encounters and refer back to them later.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>While a strong IQ is very useful for solving problems, it only really applies within yourself - your IQ describes how well you might solve a problem, but it won&rsquo;t help you guide someone else to solving theirs.</p>
        <p>Given that most work involves working with, for or leading others, developing and growing one&rsquo;s EQ is vital. The more effectively one can work with others, the further they are likely to reach in their careers, social circles and even improve their own mental health by developing stronger and more meaningful connections with others.</p>
        <p>So while your IQ might help you solve that one problem you&rsquo;ve been working on, EQ will help you solve that problem as part of your overall team - a trait that matters more and more the higher up the ladder you climb.</p>
