          <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Right! We've done some HTML, jazzed it up with a little CSS and now we've got a website.<br>
            And what a website it is! It holds information, displays it and lets users navigate about. Job done, right?</p>
          <p>Well kind of. See, our website exists and works but it's not much more than a collection of pages and items, it's not very <strong>dynamic</strong>, is it?</p>
          <h2>So what DO we have?</h2>
          <p>All we currently have is a bunch of HTML elements and a bit of CSS styling that could just as well be screenshots uploaded!</p>
          <p>HTML and CSS are the same stuff though, aren't they?<br>
            No... Maybe we should have a refresher.</p>
          <h2>What's up with that HTML and CSS stuff?</h2>
          <p>Most websites are made of HTML and CSS files, at their most basic.<br>
          They look very similar, and work very closely with each other but the difference is basically this:</p>
          <p>HTML is a sort of framework, a list. It's a document containing all the differnt pieces of text, images, boxes, buttons and the likes that make up the webpage. It's no
              more than a text document, really, a list of different <strong>elements</strong> and a rough idea of which ones are inside the others.
          </p>
          <p>That's why we we create some <strong>styles</strong> with our CSS document.</p>
          <p>On its own, a CSS file is even less exciting than an HTML document, at least we HTML we get an ugly list of parts while with CSS, you wouldn't see anything at all!</p>
          <p>CSS files exist to tell the HTML Elements how they should look, where they should sit on the page and where they should sit compared to each other</p>
          <p><strong>In short, HTML describes WHAT is in your page and CSS describes HOW that stuff should be shown!</strong></p>
          <h2>What about that Control Flow and Looping carry on? Sounds like setting up hosepipes to me</h2>
          <p>Well, my sarcastic alter ego, that's a pretty</p>
