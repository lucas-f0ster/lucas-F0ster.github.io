    <h1>Classes vs IDs</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We're writing some HTML code, making a sweet webpage like the one you're on
      we're having a good time, got a few snazzy DIVs, a couple IMGs and maybe a few paragraphs for flavour.</p>
    <p>But wait! All our little pieces (or <strong>elements</strong> if you're feeling fancy)
      are sitting on the screen in a big vertical line, they're all plain and boring and while
      they have all the information, they don't look very good!<br>
      We're going to need to jazz them up a little, we're going to give them some <strong>style</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <pre style="background: none; margin-left: -70px; margin-right: 0%; overflow: hidden;"><code class="language-css">
          h1 {
            font-family: "Zen Dots";
            font-size: 30px;
          }
          h2 {
              font-family: "Roboto";
              font-weight: bold;
              font-size: 20px;
          }
          p {
              font-family: "Roboto";
              font-size: 18px;
          }
          </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Yeah, like that!<br>
      In fact, those are some of the styles for the page you're seeing right now! &#128521</p>
    <p>If we take a look at that formatting, we can see some pieces that make sense; font-size does
      what it says, we can see names of fonts next to "font-family" and so on.</p>
    <p>But what's with those little <strong>"h1"</strong> and <strong>"h2"</strong> bits? They're not in the brackets,
      so they must be important, right?<br>
      Well they are! Those little headings are how we reference specific elements
      in the HTML code (the one that builds stuff) from our CSS code (the one that tells it how to look and behave).</p>
    <p>But what does <strong>"h1"</strong> mean?<br>
      Well, <strong>h1</strong> is a built in part of HTML, it's the highest level (meaning biggest, most important)
      heading - just like the ones you can choose in Word.<br>
      There's an <strong>h1</strong> heading at the top of this page, you're reading a <strong>"p"</strong> (or
      paragraph) right now.</p>
    <p>Getting the gist? CSS applies styles to HTML elements, and they need labels so the CSS can be identified.<br>
      But what if we want to apply some CSS to something that ISN'T built into HTML? What if we want to apply a style to
      that snazzy
      block of code you just scrolled past?</p>
    <p>Well for that, we need to describe that content, and for that we use either an ID or a Class, collectively these
      are known as <strong>"hooks"</strong>.<br>
      So, how do we use these? What's the difference? What could they look like?</p>
    <p>This ain't short, so <a href="#tldr">here's a quick link to a TL;DR</a> for the impatient reader</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How does a hook work?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Just like you'd expect! When we create an element, we give it a hook to label it as something, so that our CSS or
      any other code we want to apply to it
      will know how to find it. <br>
      For example, this jumble of words lives inside a <code class="lang-html">div</code>, essentially a container to
      hold content.<br>
      Text on its own looks super boring, though, like this mess down below:</p>
    <br>
  </div>
  Here's some totally unformatted text, isn't it pretty?
  <br>
  <div id="post-container">
    <p>So let's make our Div all nice and pretty. For that, we need to give it some style in our CSS file.<br>
      But before that can happen, we need to give it a name so our CSS knows where its styles should go.</p>
    <p>This means adding an ID name into our div (this one is called "post-container", for obvious reasons), which means
      our Div tag now looks like this:</p>

    <div class="code-container">
      <pre style="background: none; margin-left: -70px; margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: -40px; overflow: hidden;"><code class="language-html">
            <script type="prism-html-markup">
          <div id="post-container">
            <p>some text</P>
          </div>
            </script>
          </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Pretty easy, huh?<br>
      Well, giving an element a Class works exactly the same way, check it out:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <pre style="background: none; margin-left: -70px; margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: -40px; overflow: hidden;"><code class="language-html">
            <script type="prism-html-markup">
          <div class="post-container">
            <p>some text</P>
          </div>
            </script>
          </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Yep, you can literally just switch ID and Class around and things will work pretty much as they should.<br>
      To refer to these two divs in our CSS, we just need to refer to either the Class or the ID, like this:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <pre style="background: none; margin-left: -70px; margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: -40px; overflow: hidden;"><code class="language-css">
          /*this is how to refer to an ID*/
          
          #post-container {
            width: 60%;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            background: #fff;
            text-align: left;
            padding-bottom: 50px;
            padding-top: 50px;
          }

          /*and this is referring to a class*/

          .post-container {
            width: 60%;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            background: #fff;
            text-align: left;
            padding-bottom: 50px;
            padding-top: 50px;
          }
          </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Just like before, we really did just switch a "." for a "#", that's how easy it is!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>So what's the difference?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Since an ID and a Class serve basically the same function, can be swapped by changing a whole one character on
      the HTML and the CSS files,
      what's different about them? Why should you use one and not there other?</p>
    <p>Well...</p>
    <h2>An ID is unique and a Class is not</h2>
    <p>There's your answer. An element can only have <strong>one</strong> ID, and an ID can only apply to
      <strong>one</strong> element on any given page,
      while an element can have <strong>many</strong> classes and those classes can apply to <strong>many</strong>
      elements over and over.
    </p>
    <p>This makes an ID very useful for something that appears once on a page (like the post-container that holds
      everything you see) while
      a class is useful for applying code to an element that pops up lots of times (like the code-container holding
      those lovely code snippets).
    </p>
    <p>Technically, CSS doesn't actually care which one you use, it can apply the same styling to an ID or a Class. But
      if you want to use JavaScript,
      that's where you'll have problems, since JavaScript really does care if you've thrown a dozen identical IDs around
      and will have a meltdown.<br>
      The other thing that cares? Your browser! Your browser can see each ID and can jump straight to a specific ID
      using a # link (like index.html#your-ID),
      but that's not going to work when that ID sends it to two places at once...</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="tldr">Can we TL'DR this novel please? My head hurts..</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Sure we can!<br><br>IDs and Classes do the same job, they're
      written into HTML to tell other code where things are and where to do their work.<br>
      Their difference is in how they're used, IDs are unique and for one element each while Classes aren't an can be
      used over and over for repeated elements.<br><br>
      <br>
      Got it? Good!
